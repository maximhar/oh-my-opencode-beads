Oh My OpenCode

oMoMoMoMoMo···


If you work in tech, you would have liked [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code).
If you are a hacker, you will love [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).

People who write code not just for money,
But those who write code with sincerity.

[OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) is highly extensible and extremely customizable. Also, no stupid screen flickering.
LSPs, linters, and formatters activate automatically and are customizable. You can use your own models, and mix & orchestrate them.
It has many features. Beautiful, and high-performance.

And the problem that follows: there is too much to know and it is hard for beginners.

Heavily influenced and inspired by [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com) and [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), implementing their features here as-is, or even better. We are standing on the shoulders of the open-source giant, after all.

Better [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com), Better [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), or you can think of it as a kind of distribution.

I pursue LLM polytheism, and for the sake of your finances, I recommend CliProxy or VibeProxy. Take only the best advantages of the frontier labs' LLMs.

**Note**: This setup is Highly Opinionated, and since it includes the general-purpose parts of the setup I use, it is continuously updated. I have spent $20,000 worth of tokens solely for personal development purposes so far, and this plugin is the highlight of those experiences. You just take the best. If you have a better suggestion, contributions are always welcome.

I currently don't have access to my NPM account. I'll update this section as soon as I get it back.
